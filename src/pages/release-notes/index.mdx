# Release Notes

<br />

- Poker session owners can now make themselves an observer, seems obvious ðŸ™ƒ

<br />

## 31st May 2020

- Updated authentication to use [refresh tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/concepts/refresh-tokens) so you don't have to login everytime you access the site!
- Added the ability for a session owner to set participants as observers.
  - Observers cannot vote, but they can give reactions!
- Changes to the web app are now published in the new [release notes](/release-notes) page.

<br />

## 24th May 2020

- Poker session participants can now change their vote after the big reveal, _if_ the session owner allows it.
  - To facilitate this change the voting/react ui has been changed to a tabbed interface.
  - As a systemic brucie bonus, reactions can now be given before the voting phase has completed!
- Added a "break-time" coffee cup reaction to poker sessions, for occasions where you desperately need to intake/outake fluids.
- Finally added a fancy loader for lengthy page transitions or server requests.
